Betta is a Google Chrome extension that aims to improve its users' focus. Users are responsible for their virtual pet bettas, and must stay focused to keep their fish alive. Users are able to view, access, and edit their “banned” website list through the Betta chrome extension. Visiting "banned" websites causes the fish to decrease in health, which may eventually lead to its death. Steering clear of such websites is beneficial to the betta.
